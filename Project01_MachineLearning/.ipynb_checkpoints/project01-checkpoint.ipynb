    "Our experiment will attempt to create a model that will predict whether a dog will be adopoted within 1 week of it arrival at the Austin Animal Shelter in Austin, TX. We are interested in animal welfare and we know anecdotally that certain characteristics (such as a particular breed or color) of an animal result in a higher likelihood of adoption. We are interested in finding out which characteristics are the best predictors for a speedy adoption at this particular shelter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information would be useful to a shelter for many reasons. For example, if this shelter has success placing dogs with certain characteristics, it could raise the adoption fees of those dogs to help cover the shelter costs, knowing that a popular type of dog will perhaps have more people interested in it despite the higher fee. This research could also be duplicated at other shelters, and the differences in popular dog characteristics in different regions could be examined; if the Austin Animal Shelter has a high probability of placing pit bulls in homes, but a shelter in Dallas does not have that same level of success, a transfer program could be arranged in order to facilitate the best chance of a dog finding a new home. There are numerous other applications for this research so we feel that it is relevant and exciting project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the Austin Animal Shelter as the source for our data for a couple of reasons. First, this is the largest no-kill shelter in the country, so the set of data is large. Second, this data is available via public API through Austin's Open Data Portal. As quoted from the website: \"We encourage the use of public data that the City of Austin has published to spark innovation, promote public collaboration, increase government transparency, and inform decision making\" (citation: https://data.austintexas.gov/). Ethically, this dataset does not pose any issues since it is explicity made publically available and it does not contain any sensitive personal information that could lead to any type of discrimation or bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset description: Our data came in two datasets, one for intakes and one for outcomes (such as adoption) for each animal's shelter stay. Both datasets had descriptive information of the animal (animal type, intake condition, color, breed, sex, intake type/outcome type, age, name) as well as a time stamp for its intake or outcome."

Our models seem to be gaining at least some valuable information from the features other than age, but overall our model is not performing too well. After seeing the feature importance values from the Random Forests algorithm, we predicted that our model would not perform very well since most features had a very low importance value.\n",

If we had more information from the shelter, we perhaps could accurately assume that the first breed or color listed is the most prominent (example: beagle/lab is most prominently a beagle and we would drop the lab portion) and only use that for predicting and see if that improved the model.

    "In this project, we sourced publicly avaiable data from the Austin Animal Shelter (via archive). We used this data to attempt to predict whether a dog will be adopted from the shelter within a week based on certain characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had two datasets: one for intakes and one for outcomes. We merged these together on Animal ID. We preprocessed the data by limiting the dataset to just dogs, dropping rows with missing values, altering color order for consistency, and including only the top 30 breeds and colors. We also calculated our outcome of interest using the intake and outcome time differences; success (1) was a shelter stay time duration of less than a week, everything else was a failure (0) for our question of interest. We encoded categorical columns and scaled our numeric column, selected the 20 most important features, then moved forward with fitting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compared three algorithms for model fitting: logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors. Decision trees outperformed the other 2 slightly, with an accuracy of 0.644. This model shows potential; 0.644 seems like a good starting point to try and improve from further in future exploration and research. For a final model we would aim\n",
    "for a higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we see a lot of potential for future research building upon what we have done here.\n"
